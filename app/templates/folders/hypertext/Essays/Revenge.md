# Revenge

Revenge is a form of untamed justice: the more strongly human nature inclines toward it, the more the law ought to suppress it. An initial wrongdoing merely violates the law; revenge for that wrong, however, displaces the law entirely. To seek revenge is simply to place oneself on equal footing with one’s enemy; to forgo it is to rise above them. Pardoning is the prerogative of rulers, and as Solomon observes, “It is the glory of a person to overlook an offense.”[^1]

What has passed is irretrievable, and wise individuals have more than enough to occupy them in attending to present and future concerns. Those who dwell on past injuries merely waste their own energies.[^3] No one commits a wrong purely for the sake of wrongdoing; they do so to gain some benefit—profit, pleasure, honor, or the like.[^4] Why, then, should I be angry at someone for valuing their own interests above mine? And if a person acts wrongly out of sheer malice, that behavior resembles the thorn or the bramble, which wounds because it cannot act otherwise.[^5]

The most defensible form of revenge concerns injuries for which the law provides no remedy. Even then, one must take care that the retaliation is not itself subject to legal punishment; otherwise, one’s enemy retains the advantage, and the balance shifts two to one.[^6] Some who seek revenge want their adversary to know its source. This is the more open—and, in a sense, more honorable—approach, since the pleasure lies less in causing harm than in compelling repentance. By contrast, base and deceitful individuals resemble arrows shot in darkness.[^7]

Cosimo, Duke of Florence, once expressed a harsh view regarding betrayal or neglect by friends, treating such offenses as unforgivable. “You will read,” he said, “that we are commanded to forgive our enemies, but you will never read that we are commanded to forgive our friends.”[^8] Yet Job’s disposition reflects a sounder moral orientation: “Shall we receive good from God, and not also accept adversity?”[^9] The same reasoning applies, proportionately, to friendships.

This much is certain: anyone who devotes themselves to revenge keeps their wounds perpetually open—wounds that would otherwise heal naturally.[^10] Public acts of revenge are often successful, such as those following the deaths of Caesar, Pertinax, or Henry III of France.[^11] Private revenge, however, rarely ends well. Vindictive individuals live like witches: as they are destructive in life, so they meet unfortunate ends.[^12]


## Reference Text

Francis Bacon, “Of Revenge,” *Essays* (1625).


[^1]: Proverbs 19:11 (KJV). Bacon consistently draws on biblical wisdom literature to ground political and moral restraint, especially where private passions threaten public order.

[^3]: The emphasis on futurity aligns with Stoic ethics, particularly Seneca’s critique of anger as a passion that traps the mind in past injury (*De Ira*).

[^4]: This claim anticipates later rational-choice accounts of action: wrongdoing is instrumental, not expressive. See also Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*, V.2, on voluntary injustice.

[^5]: The metaphor naturalizes malice, suggesting that some wrongs arise from character rather than deliberation. This reflects a broadly Augustinian view of fallen human nature.

[^6]: The prudential calculus here is strikingly modern: revenge is evaluated not morally but strategically, in terms of expected loss and escalation.

[^7]: The contrast between open and covert revenge mirrors early modern honor cultures, where visibility and attribution were central to reputation. See Norbert Elias, *The Civilizing Process* (1939).

[^8]: Cosimo de’ Medici (Cosimo I, Duke of Florence) is cited as an emblem of *raison d’état*. The aphorism reflects political realism rather than Christian ethics.

[^9]: Job 2:10 (KJV). Bacon elevates patient endurance over retaliatory justice, aligning private morality with theological submission.

[^10]: This metaphor anticipates modern psychological accounts of rumination, where sustained attention to grievance prolongs emotional injury.

[^11]: The cited examples are classical and early modern political assassinations framed as acts of public vengeance. Bacon treats their “success” descriptively, not normatively.

[^12]: The comparison to witches draws on contemporary moral psychology: vindictive individuals are socially corrosive and self-destructive. The image reflects early modern beliefs linking malice, secrecy, and misfortune.
