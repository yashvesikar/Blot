# Imagination  

A strong imagination generates real effects—“a powerful imagination brings about events,” as learned scholars say. I count myself among those who feel the imagination’s force most keenly. Everyone is affected by it; some are undone by it. A single impression penetrates me so deeply that, lacking the strength to resist it, I must instead try to avoid it. I could live contentedly with none but cheerful and virtuous people. The sight of another’s suffering draws me irresistibly into suffering myself; my senses often appropriate the experience of a third party. If someone coughs repeatedly, my own throat and lungs respond. I am more reluctant to visit the sick out of duty than those to whom I feel little obligation, because I apprehend the illness I study and internalize it. I see nothing strange in the claim that imagination can produce fevers and even death in those who give it free rein and encourage its power.

Simon Thomas, a renowned physician of his time, once told a wealthy old man in Toulouse—who suffered from a persistent lung cough—that one of the best remedies would be to enjoy my company: to gaze upon the freshness of my face, to fix his thoughts upon the vigor of youth, and to fill his senses with an image of flourishing health. This, Thomas claimed, might restore the man’s constitution—though he neglected to mention that it might just as easily impair mine.

History abounds with such examples. Gallus Vibius trained his mind so rigorously in understanding madness that he lost his own judgment permanently, becoming a fool through wisdom. Others die of fear before execution, as did the man found dead on the scaffold—pardoned, unharmed—killed only by imagination. We sweat, tremble, pale, and blush at imaginary stimuli; lying in bed, we feel our bodies violently agitated by mere apprehension, sometimes to the point of surrendering consciousness. Even sleeping youth may be so overtaken by erotic imagination that dreams alone suffice to gratify desire.

Imagination has also been credited with bodily transformations. Cyppus, king of Italy, dreamed obsessively of horns after attending a bull-baiting and awoke, so the story goes, with horns on his forehead. Croesus’ son found his voice through passion. Antiochus fell ill from love for Stratonice. Pliny recounts a woman transformed into a man on her wedding day. I myself saw, near Vitry in France, a person known as Marie Germain, raised female until the age of twenty-two, who claimed to have become male through a sudden physical change brought on by exertion. Such accounts, however strange, illustrate the belief that imagination, when persistently fixed on the same desire, may imprint itself on the body.

Imagination acts not only upon oneself but upon others. Just as disease passes from body to body, so imaginative force—violently agitated—may project itself outward. Antiquity believed that certain women could kill with a glance. Mothers, it is said, imprint mental images upon unborn children. Even animals seem susceptible: a bird fixed in mutual gaze with a cat may fall dead from the tree. Whether these accounts are literally true matters less than what they reveal about human credulity and fear.

I remain uncertain whether many alleged enchantments and possessions are anything more than effects of imagination operating upon the weakest and most impressionable minds. I know a man of sound judgment who, after hearing a vivid account of another’s fainting fit, succumbed to the same condition. His cure came only when he openly acknowledged his susceptibility, thereby relieving the anxiety that sustained it.

Physicians, too, rely on imagination: they prepare patients’ minds with promises of recovery, knowing that belief assists the efficacy of treatment. I have known a man whose enemas worked even when no injection was administered—until his wife substituted plain water, at which point the effect vanished. A woman convinced she had swallowed a pin was cured when made to vomit and shown a pin placed there without her knowledge. A guest fell gravely ill after being told—falsely—that she had eaten cat meat.

These examples show how tightly mind and body are bound, each communicating its fortunes to the other. In recounting them, I do not claim their factual certainty but their plausibility. Whether they happened in Rome or Paris, to one person or another, they illustrate the capacities of human nature. My aim is not to record events but to show what may happen.

For this reason, fables—so long as they are possible—serve my purpose as well as verified facts. I profit from them equally, whether in shadow or substance. Histories often teach most through what is rare and striking. Other writers relate what has happened; my ambition, if I could reach it, would be to describe what can happen. In this, I exceed historical scruple—but I do not falsify particulars. I alter nothing, not even the smallest detail.

Those who urge me to write contemporary history do not consider how dangerous it is to speak for others’ intentions. It is safer to write of the past than the present, since one need only answer for borrowed truths. My temperament is unsuited to sustained narration; I interrupt myself, lack polish, and know little of rhetorical ornament. I write only what I can, adapting matter to my strength.

Plutarch might say that his work consists in selecting examples that illuminate virtue, and that this is enough. Whether an old story occurred exactly so or otherwise matters little, provided it serves instruction. In matters of moral inquiry, the truth of possibility is often more useful than the truth of fact.
