# Beauty  

Virtue resembles a precious stone: it is best set plainly. Accordingly, virtue is most compelling when it inhabits a body that is well-formed rather than delicately featured—one marked more by dignity of presence than by mere visual attractiveness. It is rarely observed that those who are exceptionally beautiful are also possessed of great moral virtue, as if nature were more concerned with avoiding error than with producing excellence. Such individuals often turn out polished rather than profound, attending more to manners than to virtue itself.

This is not, however, a universal rule. Augustus Caesar, Titus Vespasian, Philip the Fair of France, Edward IV of England, Alcibiades of Athens, and Ismail, the Shah of Persia, were all men of exceptional spirit and capacity, and yet were considered among the most beautiful of their age.

In matters of beauty, expression outweighs coloration, and graceful, fitting movement outweighs expression. The finest aspect of beauty is that which no painting can capture, nor even an initial encounter with the living person. There is no truly excellent beauty that lacks some irregularity of proportion. One may question whether Apelles or Albrecht Dürer was the greater pedant: the former constructing figures by strict geometric ratios, the latter assembling ideal forms by selecting the best features from many faces. Such figures, I suspect, would delight no one but the artist himself. Not that a painter cannot depict a face more beautiful than any that has existed, but this must arise from a kind of inspired felicity—like a musician composing a beautiful melody—rather than from adherence to fixed rules.

One encounters faces which, when examined feature by feature, contain nothing admirable, yet taken as a whole are pleasing. If it is true that the chief element of beauty lies in appropriate and graceful motion, it is unsurprising that older individuals often appear more amiable: *pulchrorum autumnus pulcher*—the autumn of beauty is itself beautiful. Youth can only be considered attractive by indulgence, since we excuse its excesses on account of youth itself.

Beauty resembles summer fruit: quick to spoil and unable to endure. It commonly fosters a reckless youth and leaves age somewhat ill at ease. Yet, when it is well matched to character, beauty can make virtues shine more brightly and cause vices to blush.

Francis Bacon, “Of Beauty,” *Essays* (1625).


[^1]: Bacon’s comparison of virtue to a plainly set jewel reflects a classical moral aesthetic in which restraint and proportion signal ethical seriousness; ornament risks distraction from substance.

[^2]: The claim that extreme physical beauty rarely coincides with moral excellence echoes ancient moral psychology (notably Aristotelian moderation), though Bacon tempers it with historical counterexamples.

[^3]: Bacon privileges *motion*—bearing, gesture, and comportment—over static appearance, anticipating later aesthetic theories that locate beauty in dynamism and lived presence rather than form alone.

[^4]: The emphasis on irregularity (*“some strangeness in the proportion”*) rejects strict idealization and aligns with Renaissance skepticism toward purely mathematical or composite ideals of beauty.
