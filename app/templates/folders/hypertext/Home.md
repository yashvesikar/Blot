Richard Waller is a programmer and physicist whose work centers on the formal and computational treatment of color. Trained in mathematical physics and software engineering, he approaches color as a problem spanning measurement, representation, and perception, with particular attention to the limits imposed by devices, encodings, and human vision. His technical practice integrates numerical methods, signal processing, and systems design.

# About

His research interests include color spaces, spectral models, and the translation between physical, perceptual, and digital descriptions of color. He is especially concerned with precision, reproducibility, and the epistemic assumptions embedded in color technologies. Across both theory and practice, his work treats color not as an aesthetic accessory but as a rigorously constrained object of scientific and computational inquiry.
