1. buy domain
2. create hosted zone on route 53 for new domain: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones
3. point domain to Blot's IP

Considerations:
- Updown: status page
- iCloud client: change email from link@blot.im to link@blot.site
- Stripe:
    - update business details: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/business-details
    - update webhooks endpoint: https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/webhooks
- Paypal:
  - update 'Product page URL' for each product:  https://www.paypal.com/billing/plans
  - update business owner email: https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/account/accountOwner
  - update webhooks endpoint: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/
- Mailgun:
  - does not let me add two domains at once... so remove blot.im once domain transition is complete
    - if this fails, look into SES or sending through fastmail directly
Email:
- Set up email alias on fastmail for *@blot.im then forward to contact@blot.site
