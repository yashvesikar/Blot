<h1>Obsidian</h1>

<h2>Create a website with Obsidian</h2>

<p>
  Obsidian is a Markdown note-taking app that uses plain files stored on your
  computer. Because Blot turns folders of files into websites, the two work
  well together—just point Blot at the same folder you use as your Obsidian
  vault.
</p>

<h3>Recommended settings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Set <strong>New link format</strong> to <em>relative path to file</em>. Blot
    also understands <em>absolute path in vault</em> if your vault is the root of
    your blog folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep your attachments in a folder inside the vault (Obsidian's default
    <code>attachments</code> location works). Blot mirrors this folder structure
    when publishing your site.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Organizing images</h3>

<p>
  For a clean setup when storing images used across both posts and pages, create
  a folder called <code>_Images</code> in the root of your vault. The leading
  underscore prevents Blot from treating the files inside as publishable
  content.
</p>

<p>To add an image to a note:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Drag-and-drop the image directly onto the note in Obsidian. Obsidian will
    embed the image and place the file in the root of your vault.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Obsidian sidebar, drag the image file into the <code>_Images</code>
    subfolder.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Obsidian will update the embed references automatically, and Blot will follow
  them correctly when publishing your site.
</p>

<h3>Blot features for Obsidian users</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wikilinks</strong>: Blot resolves <code>[[Links]]</code> using the
    same filename logic as Obsidian. You can customise the link text with the
    <code>[[Page name|Custom text]]</code> syntax.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Embeds</strong>: Obsidian's <code>![[...]]</code> syntax works for
    images, audio, video, PDFs, and notes. Alt text after the pipe (for example
    <code>![[File.png|Caption]]</code>) becomes the published <code>alt</code>
    attribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Markdown notes as components</strong>: Embedding another note (for
    example <code>![[Project overview]]</code>) renders the Markdown inline on
    your site, so you can reuse content in multiple posts.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  See the <a href="/how/formatting/wikilinks">wikilinks guide</a> for detailed
  examples of how embeds and link resolution behave when your notes are
  published with Blot.
