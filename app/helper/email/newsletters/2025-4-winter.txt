**New features**
- Added the [Hypertext template](https://blot.im/templates/hypertext), which is designed to be used as a digital garden. The sidebar is generated directly from the structure of your folder.
- Blot now supports the [TextBundle format](https://blot.im/how/files/markdown#textbundle), which lets you embed images in Markdown files when using apps like [Ulysses](https://blot.im/tools/ulysses) and [Bear](https://blot.im/tools/bear).
- Added [Geist fonts](https://vercel.com/font) to the font picker on the web template editor.
- You can now [highlight text](https://blot.im/how/files/markdown#highlighting) in Markdown files.
- Added a setting which inserts a heading from the file’s name if missing, making it easier to use [Obsidian](https://blot.im/tools/obsidian).

**Changes**
- Blot now delivers your site’s stylesheet and scripts through its CDN.
- The pages on your site which list [posts with a given tag](https://blot.im/how/metadata#tags) are now paginated.
- The URLs for images cached through Blot’s CDN now end with the source image file name.
- The template editor now includes a mobile preview feature and improved controls for customizing templates.
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made changes to the dashboard and documentation.

**Bug fixes**
- [Dropbox](https://blot.im/how/sync/dropbox) now syncs large files up to 100mb in size reliably, and skips syncing larger files without crashing.
- [Git client] now handles larger and longer pushes without crashing.
- Pagination handles large page numbers correctly.

**Questions**
- [Sync a github-based theme to a local folder?](https://blot.im/questions/3299)
- [Hosting a PWA on Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/3284)
- [Show posts from Substack on the start page?](https://blot.im/questions/3282)

**Mistakes**

The last period was [without a single downtime incident](https://status.blot.im) and I have dramatically improved the server stability and average response time after implementing some bot blocking measures.

However, I did cause a bug which temporarily lead to the loss of user data. The issue was caused by an edge case in a recent update that routed your site’s JS and CSS through Blot’s CDN. For users with locally edited templates, this change relies on code that writes templates into the site folder. I had recently modified that code to clean up subdirectories, which inadvertently removed .git subfolders on some affected sites.

I have restored the missing folders and updated the code to preserve all existing subdirectories. If your site was affected, you will already have heard from me directly. I’m sorry.

**Plans for the spring**
- Continue improving the templates, template-editor and developer documentation.
- As Blot continues to grow, I am scaling both the infrastructure and the application code. One upcoming change is an adjustment to how posts are stored. Currently, each post is stored as a single JSON blob in Redis, which requires fetching the entire object even when only a few fields are needed. I plan to migrate this data to Redis hashes, allowing selective retrieval of specific properties (for example, titles and URLs for archive pages), which will improve efficiency and load time for your site.
- We plan to migrate more data from local disk storage to an object-storage API. One of Blot’s main failure modes is exhausting disk space on individual servers. Moving to an effectively unbounded object store (e.g., S3-compatible storage) will eliminate this constraint.

If you have any thoughts or questions, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
