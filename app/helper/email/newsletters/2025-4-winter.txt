**New features**
- Blot now supports the [TextBundle format](https://blot.im/how/files/markdown#textbundle), which lets you embed images in Markdown files when using apps like [Ulysses](https://blot.im/tools/ulysses) and [Bear](https://blot.im/tools/bear).
- You can now use [markdown highlighting](https://blot.im/how/files/markdown#highlighting) by surrounding text with double equals signs.
- Date format strings in templates are now rendered before formatting, allowing for more dynamic date displays.
- A plugin automatically injects titles into markdown posts without them, making it easier to use Obsidian.

**Changes**
- The CDN infrastructure was improved with better manifest handling and moved from Redis to disk storage for improved reliability.
- Tagged template pages now support pagination using query parameters.
- The Dropbox file size limit was increased to 100MB.
- New Geist fonts were added to the template editor.
- Templates are now automatically forked per blog when using site templates, preventing conflicts between sites.
- The template editor received numerous improvements including better file handling, improved UI, and more reliable editing.
- Documentation improvements including guides for common tasks.
- The template editor now includes a mobile preview feature and improved controls for customizing templates.

**Bug fixes**
- [Dropbox](https://blot.im/how/sync/dropbox) now syncs large files reliably.
- [Wikilinks](https://blot.im/how/formatting/wikilinks) that reference deleted entries are handled correctly.
- The search page and question search work as expected.
- Scheduled posts publish at the correct time.
- The template editor is more reliable, with fixes for Firefox compatibility, submenu behavior, and template duplication.
- Pagination handles large page numbers correctly.
- Domain verification now uses authoritative DNS resolvers for more reliable setup.

**Questions**
- [Sync a github-based theme to a local folder?](https://blot.im/questions/3299)
- [Image folder for Obsidian?](https://blot.im/questions/3305)
- [Show posts from Substack on the start page?](https://blot.im/questions/3282)
- [Hosting a PWA on Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/3284)

**Mistakes**

The last period was [without a single downtime incident](https://status.blot.im) and I have dramatically improved the server stability and average response time after implementing some bot blocking measures.

**Plans for the spring**
- Continue improving the templates, template-editor and developer documentation.
- Blot continues to grow and this involves scaling both the infrastructure and modifying the application code to handle this scale. I intend to adjust the data structure of the post storage. Right now, posts are stored as a JSON blob in Redis, which means they must be retrieved in full. I plan to migrate carefully to redis hashes, which will mean I can retrieve a subset of entry properties (e.g. just titles and urls for the archives page).
- Migrate more of the data from disk-storage to object-storage. One of Blot's big failure points is 'the disk has run out of space' and I hope to avoid this with an infinitely scalable object storage api (e.g. S3). 

If you have any thoughts or questions, please don't hesitate to reply directly to this email.
