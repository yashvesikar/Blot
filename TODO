Make it clearer in the UI that creating a second site increases the subscription at the next billing cycle, probably with a one-time notice.

Fix bug with repeat resyncs of specific sites via Google Drive:
- To identify, run node scripts/google-drive/resync.js multiple times, some sites continually resync the same files...

Bug: CDN replaceFolder not working with relative path to CSS file on wall.blot.im

Maybe we mix cacheID into query string for {{#cdn}} on preview subdomains with caching headers for improved template editor performance without expensive hash computation?

Template delete should purge the cdn hashes / URLs

Handle 429s in purgeCDNUrls? Group multiple into single request?

Remove the legacy redis hash routing from cdn/index.js and key definition
- also create new script to forcefully migrate the dangling hashes from redis to disk, if they exist

We should get notifcations when stripe recovers an overdue subscription, as opposed to the user entering the form

invalid package.json causes crazy error on template editor (missing colon)

Speed up global template build by not even invoke the setView function if there are no changes... (this avoids running updateCDNManifest when SITE template has no changes)

Dashboard file upload feature (_url) needs to generate image dimensions too.. maybe it needs MORE power

Blogs have huge numbers of archived templates – modify the tempalte archiver to only 'create' templates for sites using them, otherwise disappear them. work out how to clean up some of the many archived templates added to sites... (remove ones with zero changes?)

Fix script to replace cssURL to handle blogs with invalid domains (it's breaking the migration)

Replace existing cssURL and scriptURL and css_url and script_url properties in templates with new cdn helper
- do this by editing the templates
- once confirmed all templates are fixed, remove the code and documentation for these variables

Replace existing asset helper properties in templates with new cdn helper
- Check it's only used for CSS/JS...

Enforce size limits on setting tempalte views
Add integration tests for cdn paths with weird view names, etc.
Add integration tests for preview subdomain logic (skip for my- not for site)

Add more options to site settings beyond title, such as description and reply email, and tell Omar
Allow text entry fields in template settings from the dashboard for template locals, and tell Omar
Add multiple date format selectors on the theme dashboard for different contexts, and tell Omar
Introduce collapsible sections or a separately scrollable div on the template dashboard settings, and tell Omar

Can we optimize renderView in some way?
- use lru cache or moize libraries? back against cacheID property of blog?
- Memoize load template / load full view / load blog... others?
- use a proper library, cap memory, etc.
- should majorly improve performance on popular sites

verify that nginx config serves as many CDN static files as possible
- eventually these files will be on s3 but for now, use nginx with try files where possible then pass on to upstream

Resolve inconsistency: 'Create site' vs New template vs Create file

'Preview' link on template editor should become 'Visit site' for installed template
- or maybe add a new button 'visit site'?

Fix iCloud bugs
- Work out issue with iCloud disconnect / setup with [Florian's folder](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzQZTzSJsxwwRTMNxWTMrGCQXTlh)
- It seems we ran into an issue where icloud was not syncing *updates* to an existing file. When we perform a full sync, can we force brctl download for each folder? is that enough? or do we need to brctl download each file too? 
- Investigate the 500 timeout errors – are these caused by pending syncs / folder locks?
  - tail -n 1000000 /var/instance-ssd/logs/access.log | grep " 500 " | grep "/clients/icloud"
- Why are there unrenamed folders in the mac server icloud drive?
  - partial incomplete setup? sharing a non-empty folder? 
- Smooth over setup process, add guidance for 'mode' of share panel (e.g. copy vs. collaborate) and maybe a screenshot

Fix possible bug with changing folder name in Google Drive from uppercase to lowercase (what happens to file inside?). Is this related to entry lookup for deleted files? How was the missing ghost file undeleteable? the case of one variant was deleted but the other was not. The case of the ID mismatched. The folder lock was stuck.

Fix bug with 'failed to update folder lock' that throws an error – is the issue ebs?
- I can't reproduce the problem locally.
- Problem occurs with all the clients it seems
- Can we reproduce by attempting to acquire 50 locks in parallel in production?
  - I tried this and it didn't seem to trigger the bug
  - Is this correlated with high disk activity?
- will fix bug with concurrent syncs from iCloud client by enforcing a build timeout in sync/set.js so we can accurately set the upload request timeout for the iCloud client (line 63 of upload.js)

- Something seems to clobber on the navigation with the existing 'Home' link

Fix bugs with custom domain setup
- Enter invalid domain and get (message 'domain removed') instead of error
- Validate the domain is pointing to Blot before allowing resty-auto-ssl to request a cert. we seem to get into a DNS mismatch where a client thinks a domain points to Blot, and triggers a cert request through resty-auto-ssl but whatever DNS server Blot's server points to has the stale record (pointing elsewhere)
- Disable redirect to HTTPS for blogs by default (to ensure old browsers without SNI work) but ensure all prominent links to the blog on dashboard use HTTPS
- cache domain validity and display checkmark on dashboard

- don't delete custom domain, though (maybe add property redirectDomain ?)

Think about how to improve the efficieny of the app/views/js/sync_status.js response from the server when loading the new contents of `.live-updates`. perhaps we could intercept send requests and use cheerio to filter out everything except the live update div? or some other method? and once we do that we could then leverage etags for improved performance too

Add screenshot feature to macserver:
1. Under `app/clients/icloud/macserver/`, introduce a reusable screenshot service (e.g., `screenshot/index.js`) that encapsulates the current Puppeteer workflow from `app/helper/screenshot/index.js` (viewport options, Bottleneck throttling, retry/restart handling). Ensure it accepts `{ url, width?, height?, mobile? }`, returns a PNG buffer, and handles cleanup/restarts just like the existing helper.
2. Add an authenticated Express route (`routes/screenshot.js`) that validates the request body, invokes the new screenshot service, and streams the PNG bytes with `Content-Type: image/png`. Register it in `macserver/index.js`.
3. Extend `app/clients/icloud/macserver/package.json` with any new dependencies (`puppeteer`, `bottleneck`, etc.) required by the migrated implementation.
4. Replace the implementation of `app/helper/screenshot/index.js` so it becomes a thin HTTP client: read `config.icloud.server_address` and `config.icloud.secret`, POST the screenshot request (including optional width/height/mobile) to the macserver endpoint, stream the binary response to the destination path, and keep the existing retry behavior for network errors.
5. Update the screenshot unit tests to exercise the new HTTP client (spin up a fixture server that mimics the macserver response, assert file output, and keep rate-limit coverage). Adjust any other code paths (e.g., `app/site/tests/util/setup.js`) that import Puppeteer so they either switch to the macserver flow or conditionally skip when Puppeteer is no longer present.
6. Remove Chromium/Puppeteer-specific setup from `Dockerfile` (package installs, `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`) and drop the Puppeteer dependency from the root `package.json`, ensuring documentation or deployment scripts (e.g., `scripts/deploy/constants.js` if applicable) reflect that the main container no longer bundles Chromium.

Create abstract models/storage that could be used to eventually migrate blog data folders onto s3:
- 1. Add `app/storage/index.js` that exposes namespaced helpers (e.g., `storage.blogs.resolve(blogID, relativePath)`, `storage.blogs.readFile`, `storage.static.writeFile`) implemented with `fs-extra` and the existing `config.blog_folder_dir` / `config.blog_static_files_dir`.
- 2. Move the path normalization logic from `helper/localPath.js` into the new storage module (or have `localPath` call the storage API), keeping existing validations intact.
- 3. Provide unit coverage mirroring `app/helper/tests/localPath.js` to confirm the new abstraction still resolves paths correctly for typical blog IDs and paths.
- 4. Add mechanism for error storage, e.g. Dropbox .page file error or Dropbox file too large error, etc.

Look into figma make

Improve server performance by 1. Create `app/build/plugins/folderAssets/index.js` that exports a `render` handler; reuse the logic from `app/blog/render/replaceFolderLinks/html.js` and `lookupFile` so it asynchronously rewrites `<a href>`/`<img src>` etc. during build-time processing to CDN urls, resolving the correct case where needed.
- 2. Register the plugin in `app/build/plugins/index.js` so it runs for HTML entries (respecting `options.isHTML`) and make it default-enabled for blogs.
- 3. Add new tests under `app/build/plugins/folderAssets/tests` to confirm the plugin emits CDN URLs and leaves untouched cases alone.

Can we use lightningcss to replace the existing css minifier for performance?

Transformer should short-circuit network lookups to {{config.host}} or {{cdn}} urls and pull the files directly
- and have limits on resource size and time

Migrate JSON blob entry into a redis hash:
- Use hash to store entries rather than a JSON string:
- app/models/entry/get.js
- Every time a single entry is fetched we retrieve a full JSON string then JSON parse it.
- I want to switch to using a redis hash and make it possible to query single entry properties, e.g. html, title
- Do we have enough space in redis to essentially duplicate every entry?  maybe make it possible to store an entry as both a hash and a string initially (with hash as source of truth in case of conflict). we'll need a script to run to migrate existing entries in the db. once the migration is complete, we can remove some of the doubled code
- * Extend `app/models/entry/key.js` with a helper that returns the Redis hash key for an entry (e.g., `entryHash(blogID, path)`), keeping the existing string key untouched for backward compatibility.
* Add a serializer/deserializer utility (new module under `app/models/entry/`, e.g., `format.js`) that can translate between `Entry` objects and hash field payloads (strings stay raw; other types use `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`).
* Refactor `app/models/entry/get.js` to accept an optional `fields` argument (string or array). Use `multi` to `HMGET`/`HGETALL` from the hash key and fall back to the JSON key when the hash is missing, reusing the serializer to coerce types. Ensure single-field calls return the scalar when only one entry is requested, while preserving existing behaviors for callers expecting full `Entry` objects.
* Cover the new pathways with unit coverage (or targeted integration coverage) once tests are runnable, verifying full-entry fetches, hash fallback to legacy JSON, and single-field lookups.

Improve performance rendering sitemaps by using sitemap indexes, and sharding the sitemap.
- requires adding pagination for listing pages
- requires using the url / param feature, e.g. [sitemap.xml, sitemap.posts.:page.xml, sitemap.pages.:page.xml]

    - should resolve issue with `https://eli.li/tagged/og`
- Improve various performance issues with archives page and sitemap on large sites - maybe allEntries only retrieves some properties and paginates through rather than a single request?
  - highlighted by `https://jimhardy-datascience.com/search?q=2026` and `https://www.nitinpai.in/archives`
  - basically, we need to modify the template engine to save the properties of each entry requested, then use this in entry.get, then update entry to use a hash rather than a json blob.
- why is the feed so huge? are we compressing feeds? so slow for nginx?
- we need to modify the template engine to extract which properties of the entry are used, then pass this into entry.get to reduce memory usage significantly for large sites.
- maybe write tool to check before/after for lots of test sites? real life sites on blot? error if diff, or offer chance to test?

Improve iCloud client
- Resolve flakiness disconnecting, transfering existing folder contents
    ## 1. Harden sync pipeline
    - [ ] Add integration tests covering end-to-end sync flows via `sync/toiCloud.js` and `sync/fromiCloud.js`, including handling of deletions, renames, and empty files.
    - [ ] Implement retry and backoff logic around mac server HTTP uploads (`macserver/httpClient/upload.js`) and downloads (`macserver/brctl/download.js`) to recover from transient iCloud errors.
    - [ ] Enforce a configurable timeout and cancellation for build jobs triggered by iCloud sync events to avoid the concurrent sync bug referenced in `sync/set.js`.

    ## 2. Improve failure detection and reporting
    - [ ] Expand monitoring in `util/monitorMacServerStats.js` to include latency/health metrics for the mac server watcher (`macserver/monitorer.js`).
    - [ ] Emit structured logs for sync actions with correlation identifiers to aid debugging across the mac server and main server.
    - [ ] Surface actionable error states on the dashboard (`routes/dashboard.js`) so users know when their iCloud folder is disconnected or low on space.

    ## 3. Safeguard shared folder lifecycle
    - [ ] Ensure `initialTransfer.js` and `sync/toiCloud.js` gracefully handle folders removed or unshared mid-transfer, surfacing a clear recovery flow.
    - [ ] Add background reconciliation (`util/resyncRecentlySynced.js`) that re-validates folder permissions and resyncs divergent files on a schedule.
    - [ ] Extend setup flows (`routes/site/index.js`) to validate sharing links and alert when the mac server cannot access the shared directory.

    ## 4. Resource management on mac server
    - [ ] Add guardrails in `macserver/watcher/monitorDiskUsage.js` to trigger automated eviction via `macserver/brctl/evict.js` before the quota limit is hit.
    - [ ] Track iCloud space utilization trends so administrators receive early warnings (leveraging templates in `app/helper/email/admin`).
    - [ ] Validate file size limits at the edge (`routes/site/index.js`) to prevent oversized uploads from reaching the mac server.

    ## 5. Operational readiness
    - [ ] Document recovery playbooks for incidents such as `ICLOUD_SERVER_PANIC` and `ICLOUD_SERVER_DOWN`, including SSH commands and validation steps.
    - [ ] Automate smoke tests that can be run post-deployment to verify critical sync paths and folder permissions.
    - [ ] Provide a feature flag to disable iCloud sync per-site, allowing rollback without affecting other clients.

- add proper bottlenecks then run this regularly

Add https://www.textasticapp.com/ to text editor tools

Ensure we handle google doc link cards properly

Write proper tests for clients:
- Dropbox
- Google Drive
    * Build a reusable `nock` helper (e.g., `app/clients/google-drive/tests/nockDrive.js`) that can stub the Drive endpoints used by `sync/sync.js`, `write.js`, `remove.js`, and webhook setup.
    * Add Jasmine specs that cover edge cases such as folder moves, duplicate file names, MD5 mismatches, and quota errors by exercising the high-level functions and asserting that `database.folder` updates correctly.
    * Unskip and modernize `serviceAccount/tests/refresh.js`, using the new mock helper to simulate `drive.about.get`, and ensure the suite runs via the existing `scripts/tests/invoke.sh`.
    * Update the test harness (e.g., by adding the new spec directory to `scripts/tests/invoke.sh` or test globbing) so the Drive client tests execute in CI.

Improve git client
    1. **Harden sync against transient Git failures**  
      * Add structured error handling and exponential backoff to the fetch and reset steps in [`sync.js`](./sync.js) so transient network or repository errors do not abort the entire sync.  
      * Surface actionable messages to `folder.log` when retries are exhausted to aid diagnostics.

    2. **Persist sync progress for crash recovery**  
      * Introduce a lightweight journal that records in-flight operations in the local blog directory before they execute.  
      * Extend the startup path to replay or roll back the journal if the process restarts mid-sync, ensuring we do not leave the repo in a partially reset state.  
      * Cover this behaviour with an automated test that simulates a restart during `git.fetch`/`git.reset` (see existing fixtures under `tests/sync.js`).

    3. **Validate repository state before destructive actions**  
      * Before running `git.reset --hard origin/master`, verify that the `origin/master` ref exists and that the working tree is clean to avoid losing local edits created outside the client.  
      * If divergence is detected, fail gracefully with guidance for the user rather than clobbering their changes.  
      * Document the decision flow in developer docs so operational playbooks account for these safeguards.

    4. **Monitor and alert on repeated sync failures**  
      * Emit structured metrics (e.g., to StatsD) whenever retries fail or the sync loop exits due to repeated errors.  
      * Add a dashboard surface or notification hook so operators and customers can see when their Git repo needs manual attention.  
      * Backfill tests that stub the metrics emitter to ensure the instrumentation does not break the sync flow.
      
Improve google drive client
    ## 1. Harden service-account webhook lifecycle
    - **Problem**: Changes and files webhooks can expire silently, causing the sync queue to stall until manual intervention. Logs in `serviceAccount/watchChanges.js` and the reset scripts indicate we rely on cron-style resets rather than active monitoring.
    - **Tasks**:
      - Add persistent records for each active channel (channel ID, resource ID, expiration) in the database so their state survives restarts.
      - Create a periodic job to compare expected expirations with Google Drive and renew channels a day before expiry; alert on failures via existing admin email helpers.
      - Extend teardown logic in `scripts/google-drive/purgeWebhooks.js` to remove entries for channels that were renewed or cancelled.

    ## 2. Improve resilience of initial folder setup
    - **Problem**: The setup flow in `routes/setup.js` and `init.js` resets on process restarts, which forces users to repeat sharing steps.
    - **Tasks**:
      - Persist setup progress in the site's database record (e.g., storing the setup step and timestamps) so workers can resume after restarts.
      - Add retries around Drive permission propagation (currently a single attempt) with exponential backoff and user-facing status updates.
      - Write integration tests that simulate restarts by clearing in-memory state while preserving persisted progress.

    ## 3. Detect and repair sync drift automatically
    - **Problem**: Reports in TODO mention phantom re-downloads and missing deletions after Drive folder renames. These indicate our mapping of Drive file IDs to local paths can fall out of sync.
    - **Tasks**:
      - Add a periodic audit job that samples a blog's Drive folder using `sync/sync.js` traversal and compares hashes with local metadata.
      - When drift is detected (hash mismatch, missing file, duplicate title), queue a targeted resync using existing `resetToDrive` utilities instead of a full rebuild.
      - Surface audit findings on the dashboard (`routes/dashboard.js`) so users know when a repair was triggered.

    ## 4. Expand automated test coverage with mocked Drive APIs
    - **Problem**: Failures are often discovered in production because we have limited regression tests (`serviceAccount/tests/refresh.js` is the only automated test).
    - **Tasks**:
      - Introduce a reusable `nock`-based mock layer for Drive HTTP requests so tests can simulate API responses, rate limits, and quota errors.
      - Cover edge cases for file moves, deduplicated names, and quota errors across `sync/index.js`, `write.js`, and `remove.js`.
      - Integrate these tests into CI to prevent regressions when modifying sync logic.

    ## 5. Enhance observability and alerting
    - **Problem**: Errors logged with `prefix()` helpers are not aggregated, making it hard to spot failures quickly.
    - **Tasks**:
      - Standardize log fields (site ID, service account ID, operation) and ship them to the central logging service.
      - Add metrics counters for sync successes/failures and webhook renewals, exporting them to the existing monitoring stack.
      - Configure threshold-based alerts for repeated failures or prolonged absence of successful syncs per site.

Move from EBS to s3
- Goal is cost reduction and improved scalability
  - should lower storage costs + transfer from $200/month to $20/month
  - no more charges for unused GB disk space
  - lower cost of S3 vs EBS
  - no issue of 'running out of space' which has taken down service multiple times
- General considerations:
  - what s3 category to use? standard? 1 zone express? latency is important for some use-cases, e.g. blog folder
  - the static files (e.g. thumbnails) are more long term infrequent access though (because of CDN)
  - do we re-organize how files are stored? one bucket per site?
  - make sure s3 versioning is disabled?
  - how to back up? maybe have a special bucket for blog folder data? everything else is downstream of the folder
- Come up with plan for static files directory
  - rewrite docx, odt, clients to use a temp dir, then
  - create an abstract helper function which can be used to write files to static directory
    - make this file also upload to s3
    - write script to sync existing static files to s3
  - we probably don't need a caching layer for static files since static files will end up in CDN storage after first request
- Come up with plan for blog files directory
 - abstract write / read from blog directory
 - we probably need a caching layer using instance SSD as LRU cache of say 10GB
  - when we rebuild all files on a site, we'll probably want to download all the folder? or maybe just have a SSD LRU caching layer built in that can adapt.
- Rewrite git client as follows:
  - Store bare repos (e.g. blog.git) on s3 as source of truth
  - On push, fetch bare repo from s3 and store it on instance SSD in 'cache' 
  - After push, resync bare repo to s3
  - Compare diff on bare repo to identify changed files
  - For new or modified files, check out those files only to a tmp folder and then copy across to blog folder dir directly and trigger folder.update
  - Remove the live repo from the blog folder dir
  - Other ideas which I decided against:
    - I thought about using an s3fs but it seems risky and likely too slow
 - Once this is done, the nginx + node server is 'stateless' and could be replicated easily across aws regions
 - We could combine this with the containerization of openresty

Resolve bad links (e.g. incorrect case) in files at build-time rather than run-time so we can avoid the expensive disk lookups in blog/assets.js

Use tinify free api to compress some of the folder images?
- maybe consider building this into the main product? it might pay for itself

Add asset library / file upload to template editor and share files across templates
- use this to help implement a favicon feature which minifies the favicon

Extend markdown parser to add a special class to a list of only images for targeting into an image grid or gallery?
- `- ![Image](_image.jpg)...` -> `<ul class="image-list">`... could then be used in CSS?

Extract multiple thumbnails per blog post (as many as there are images) for cooler image grid possibilities.

Add an open folder button to Local folder client
- maybe add a highlevel function which clients can expose to open a file (e.g. link to dropbox.com or google drive)?

Run image analysis on all images in post
- extract colors for searching
- use something to identify related images

Improve tools section

Write a guide to using Formspark to add a contact form to a site

Add an option to use the date modified property of the file, rather than the date created property as the publish date. This would be especially useful for the Dropbox client, which nukes the original file creation date but preserves the client modified data. This should be opt in because it could lead to misleading behaviour where an old file is dragged into your folder and is published way deep in your archives. Tell [Dirt](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzQZTMSlvtWcHcckPtWlJljHVPdH)

Improvements to local folder experience

Improvements to Google Drive client
- [ ] new folder setup (e.g. waiting for user to share folder on drive) needs to survive a server restart (See init.js TODO)
- [ ] slowly resync all connected blogs on server restart
- [ ] It seems like sometimes the first sentence of Google Docs become titles unexpectedly – possibly a mis-identified title tag?
- [ ] make it possible to short-circuit the full folder traversal and immediately begin at a specific file/subfolder
- [ ] to improve sync speed, eventually set up temporary channels to watch google docs for changes – is this faster than polling driveactivity? or work out the fastest way to get fast updates for google docs. Is the move to listen on changes.watch and then setup an optional temporary files.watch channel to stream changes for the length of the channel (don't renew)?
- [ ] add tests with nock
- [ ] Test multiple sites sync in parallel
- [ ] Test multiple Google Drive accounts in parallel
- [ ] On disconnect, convert Google Docs in folder into Markdown and inform the user
  - tell henryirvine about this affecting his site
- [ ] Test drafts
- [ ] Test local templates
- How do we handle two files with same name and same parent? How does our fileId:path hash handle this? Make sure we delete the right file. Will file.title as opposed to file.name give us the deduped version?
  - Bug: move file with deduplicated name from sub folder to other folder
  - download should check for an existing file with same name but different fileId and dedupe before storing the path?
- Handle revoked credentials without tanking server
- Handle removed blog folder without error
- Handle renamed blog folder
- Can the google drive client handle a server restart during setup?
- database.folder should throw ENOENT and EEXIST errors for del, set, move etc.
- Error handling
  - Retry when we get google drive's This service is not available error
  - Handle storage quota errors
  - Handle 429 errors with exponential backoff retry
- Add a way for sync/build to accept a ctime as an option. We can't set this at the operating system level but google drive's API does return a createdTime value and we could use this as the true file's created date, rather than the date the file is made on the server
- `write` should use the best method for large file uploading
- Work out if we can test this using Mocks

Think about migrating to s3 for blog data storage
- Purge thumbnails and cached images which are no longer in use
- Abstract methods which read, write and readdir the blog folder? static files folder?
- What about pointing the CDN to an s3 bucket then redirecting to upstream for 404?
    http {
        server {
            listen 80;

            # Main location block
            location / {
                # Proxy to the S3 bucket

                proxy_pass https://$s3_bucket;

                # Pass the original Host header (required by S3)
                proxy_set_header Host $s3_bucket;

                # Handle S3 redirects properly
                proxy_redirect off;

                # If the response is 404, redirect to the fallback location
                error_page 404 = @fallback;
            }

            # Fallback location if the S3 bucket returns a 404
            location @fallback {
                # Proxy to the fallback upstream
                proxy_pass http://fallback-upstream;

                # Optional: Set a custom Host header for the fallback upstream

Investigate migrating from Redis to SQLite per-blog database
- Evaluate feasibility of storing one SQLite database per blog in data/blogs/{blogID}/blog.db
- Assess performance implications (memory usage, query speed, connection management)

- Identify all global queries that span multiple blogs (getHosts, handle/domain resolution) and plan migration strategy
- Estimate memory savings vs current Redis approach (SQLite uses OS page cache vs Redis keeping everything in RAM)
- Consider connection pooling/lazy opening strategy for managing many SQLite connections
- Evaluate concurrent write patterns and SQLite locking behavior
- Create proof-of-concept migration for entry storage (currently blog:{id}:entry:{path} in Redis)

Begin collecting proper measurements for page-rendering speed on the server

Improvements to teaser generator
- Improve estimate of teaser length
- Remove trailing non-text elements (like <hr>)
- Add {{small}} and {{long}} versions of teaser?
- Internal links (e.g. #section) in {{{teaser}}} should be resolved against the entry's permalink.
- Add hasBreakpoint property to entry to allow greater control over display of {{{teaser}}} and tell [Pratik](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwBTsfMTHqWMQFmprMcjNpdBQzp)
- Make it [possible for users to select length of teasers](https://blot.im/questions/823) and [Leo](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGqQJdjwTLkHkRZvZTQvfSzSFTq)

Make it possible to [disable draft preview files](https://blot.im/questions/3193)

Performance improvements
- Use a docker image to speed up test suite: https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot/pull/463
- Faster server, with SSL termination across CDN
- set up 'cdn.blot.im' as cloudfront distribution endpoint?
- Streamline and cache loading of data on dashboard
- Ensure node.js server has one process per CPU
- Detect CPU intensive functions in node.js process
- Use the [--trace-sync-io command-line flag](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#set-node_env-to-production) to determine if Blot is using any sync methods inappropriately
- Can we keep the pandoc child_process running and pipe stuff in and out for speed? Measure before after to ensure this helps
- Add request level timeouts to prevent server swamping
  - ensure to remove the timeout from the SSE streaming routes (drafts, sync status on dashboard)
  - read this guide: http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/timeout.html
  - it seems we also need to cancel the resources involved in responding to the request (i.e. disk io, db calls) for this to be really useful
  - Add a timeout of 15 seconds for building posts.

Server changes
- Write useful benchmark tool for Blot
- Work out how to detect stray build processes. There were a bunch of zombies consuming memory on Blot's server. Work out how to kill them safely
- Experiment with different EBS types, perhaps try to use ephemeral disk more since lower latency?
- Take full advantage of attached SSD
  - use rsync/inotify to synchronize 'source of truth' EBS disk with the local SSD cache then modify NGINX to check the synced folder on the /cache disk
  - on boot we would gently copy across all /blogs folders and the /static directory in background task

Add [line numbers](https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/) to highlight.js hljs code tags

Add end-to-end tests for brochure site to test sign up flow (use Playwright? Phantom? Chrome headless)

Improve wikilinks lookup algorithm:
- [ ] Add support for 'shortest path where possible' on Obsidian
  - [ ] search current directory for filename
  - [ ] search subdirectories for filename
  - [ ] search parent directories for filename
- [ ] Add support for 'absolute path' on Obsidian when the vault is a sub directory of your blog folder
  - [ ] How best to accomplish this?
- [ ] Add support for deleted files (e.g. [[Target]] -> target.txt still works if target.txt is renamed to foo.txt)
Support Obsidian-style media embedding and tell [questioners](https://blot.im/questions/746)

Fetch dimensions of images even if optimize and cache is disable, so that image zoom can work. Tell [Joshua](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsmhMtGvPcwxlSHSSTFVpJVbd)

Add action to lint code with jshint and eslint
  - any other static code analysis tools?
  - separate code to check for broken links, run in parallel
  
Improvements to metadata extractor:
- Improve date parser to use time from file creation date if it's within the same day as the date specified in metadata and follow up with [Nicolas](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsShbhKRcvhWJlKRPHPctMnWM)
- Adjust summary generator such that a subtitle is used for summary text (i.e. an h2 directly following an h1) We still want to prevent the scenario in which a later h2 becomes the summary, though. Notify [Jessica and rebuild Jessica's site](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/KtbxLwghhxtxrtdGHFqBRMcDGkGWtxvSdq)
- Add support for entry property with escaped double quotes, tell [Jay](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/15e396dbd8350972)

Improve questions section of site, in approximate order of importance:
  - Add way to mass-rename tags
  - Add display aliases for tags e.g. how -> How to use Blot, etc.
  - Store version history of the question and answer edits
  - give the 'ask' and 'answer' textarea inputs the full functionality of the GitHub issue/PR comment inputs (i.e. code snippets / preview / copy/paste screenshots from clipboard)
  - email notifications (There's an existing system in place for sending emails in app/helper/email)  
  - upvoting for topics and upvote-based ranking on the topic index
  - show vote count and answer count next to each question on index
  - 'run code snippet' feature / similar to trinkets.io

Adjust the chargeForRemaining function in create-blog such that the balance is added or deducted from the proration charge.

Rewrite transformer (in app/helper/transformer)
- Speak HTTP properly, respect backoffs, use/send eTags
- Share information across blogs?
- Improve transformer so it checks a file's MTIME against a stored value before rehashing the file?
- Adjust interface to accept a number of directories. Make it 'unaware' of blog IDs?
- Add method which accepts a path or URL and flushes what is stored for it, update the rebuild entry script
- Cache errors. When a post contains multiple identical links to images that timeout/404, the thumbnail generator should only make 1 attempt to fetch them. Right now we have a post that is filled with identical broken image links (in this case to a spacer.gif) can suck up the build process for hours. 

Add a 'page link format' option to the dashboard – the link format now only applies to entries. Tell [Mike](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwKkbjLjgTZLQqMFFMzBBpzMZTg)

Generate proper favicons from uploaded avatars (to prevent streched favicons when non-square avatars are uploaded)

Improvements to server infrastructure
- Work out way to recover from expired cert in the cache. To reproduce, consider a member who signed up, connected example.com, then moved the domain to another service. The attempt to renew the cert for example.com will fail. When the customer re-registers with Blot, for some reason open-resty-auto-ssl will serve an old certificate. I followed these steps to [reset](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl/issues/42) but we should automate this
- Create DMARC record for Blot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dmarc.html

Add support for posts generated from Excel files, would generate a table. Use [this library](https://github.com/joshboyan/excel-to-html-table)?

Improvements to entry builder
- Improve the automatic title generated for screenshots with default MacOs filename from 'at 14:40pm'
- Generate a list of titles which you could use to generate a table of contents and tell [Zach](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwGDNNMjbjsSKltGRLDsqXfbMhN)
- Use time draft was moved into blog folder for entry created/publish date, rather than the time the draft file itself was created. Tell [Kerim](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwDrHtwmLGkWLvLfklMwRRqDpTk) and [Shibel](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwGDWsqhHZnPjfgRqFhpdNGZVKn)
- Parse Word Document subtitles as h2 and tell [Matt](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/FMfcgxwDrlfrjDMsDlkLHNsnbtmXQtDw)
- Add way to filter entries by post type (e.g. photo) and tell [Justin](https://twitter.com/juter/status/1079767534231011330).
- If entries share publish date, sort them by blot creation date

Improvements to dashboard
- Add error messages on overdue subscription payment form
- Use \<select\> optgroup on timezone select dropdown to subdivide zones by current time, and steal the presentation format used by basecamp.
- Add a broken link checker
- Indicate that some posts' permalink will not change (if metadata) on the dashboard when setting the blog's permalink format. Tell Chet.
- Dumb quotes are still smartified, even without typeset enabled, possibly by pandoc?
- Undo option for form changes
- Add transactional emails notifying customer of changes to their email or password?
- When a customer pastes the whole tracking script into the preferences page on the dashboard, strip out everything except the ID which we need... perhaps create a page explaining what
is happening before doing this.
- Handle noscript on dashboard / signup gracefully (remove all dashboard js?)
- Allow customers who are restarting an account with multiple blogs to disable some before restarting.

- think about how to add simple password (just a string) protection to sites. 
- we need to consider both the node.js app (app/index) and the openresty reverse proxy (config/openresty), especially the proxy caching behaviour for sites. 
- perhaps we'll need to handle sessions for sites with password protection in some way at the open resty level? or just use some response header from upstream to always bypass the proxy cache? or some cookie? we don't want to add any extra work in openresty for sites without passwords. perhaps sites with passwords return responses with a header that prevents any proxy caching from taking place?
- anyway, it would involve:
- updating the blog model (password: string).
- adding a simple on/off input button to the dashboard, possibly under a new section. 
- creating a password form view common to all sites, or able to be overwritten (password.html in a template perhaps).

Add raw-link -> open graph cards/embed function, which would fetch the title, description and thumbnail for a link using <meta> tags. Tell [Robert](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGlksJFbBlWtzMHgcxcdBRBhQSJ)

- Move to neat promise chain api when 2.0 comes out
* Test that client must keep sending new entries and deleted entries when it recieved an error from entry.build otherwise you get ghost posts...
- send nice error message with instructions for 413 request too large: "git reset HEAD^" etc...
- Thoroughly document:
- Tidy up tests and reduce size and runtime
- This client should acquire a lock on the blog's folder before doing stuff to it more generally, especially during initialization etc...
- what happens if customer changes their handle? will pushing break?
  - I want them to be able to keep using their old one *until* someone else claims it, then I want 401 unauthorized, please reauthenticate with new username... but the remote path will be wrong?
- Rate limit authentication route?

Improvements to Dropbox client
- Handle file renames using Dropbox IDs to avoid the 'new entry' bug when you rename a file
- Build posts incrementally while big syncs are taking place 
- Revert lowercase for all files when disconnecting the client
- add support for Dropbox Paper files using paperDocsDownload and tell [Emad](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHMZJvMswZZXKvLfBRBVqfzksw)
- Add integration test with a dropbox Webhook call. I want to not push some code which would prevent syncing customer folders.
- Does client.remove support the removal of folders? If not, make it so and add a test
- Add a step to authentication flow which says: 'there is already a folder called 'Your blog title' in your Dropbox, would you like to use that?' then overwrite the files inside. This prevents the proliferation of confusing 'Your blog title (1)' when you re-authenticate.
- Add a progress bar to the dashboard when writing existing files to Dropbox. It takes a while and confuses people.
- Adding an additional blog to existing app folder under constant webhooks failed. New blog had correct folder but old blog still used root. I guess we need to acquire a lock on ALL blogs interacting with that dropbox account.
- Extend sync lock during long syncs
- Write test to simulate process dying and restarting mid-pull. Does the client recover?
- Write tests for a series of random dropbox client operations (pull, add, push, move, reset, delete) that can be seeded and reliably re-run in the case of failure.
- Gracefuly retry wrapper around Dropbox
- Can we write to a folder_id instead of a path? It would be nice to be able to move the blog's folder even when writing the initial files to it, for example...
- This should be simple once we copy the exisiting state of the blog folder across. But right now it doesn't really do much. It resets the local server folder. Then resyncs.
- Update to latest version of Dropbox client.
- Make the folder in Dropbox rename automatically when the customer changes the username for one of their multiple blogs?
    ## 1. Harden sync lifecycle
    - [ ] Add a watchdog for long-running sync jobs that restarts or alerts when a job exceeds an expected duration.
    - [ ] Ensure incomplete setup/sync jobs resume automatically after process restarts by persisting in-progress state and re-queueing tasks on boot.
    - [ ] Capture and retry transient Dropbox API errors with exponential backoff while surfacing hard failures for manual intervention.

    ## 2. Improve large file handling
    - [ ] Switch uploads >150 MB to the Dropbox upload session API with chunked transfer and resumable checkpoints.
    - [ ] Stream downloads to disk instead of buffering entirely in memory to prevent crashes when fetching large assets.
    - [ ] Provide user-facing warnings when a file exceeds configured limits or fails checksum validation.

    ## 3. Strengthen rename and conflict detection
    - [ ] Maintain a cache of Dropbox file IDs to correctly map renames without duplicate entries.
    - [ ] Detect folder-level moves and apply them atomically to avoid partial state during sync.
    - [ ] Validate content hashes after sync to catch divergence between Dropbox and Blot storage.

    ## 4. Expand observability and support tooling
    - [ ] Emit structured logs for setup, sync, and error paths so incidents can be correlated across services.
    - [ ] Surface active sync issues and recovery steps within the dashboard homepage to prompt user action.
    - [ ] Add automated email/notification templates for rate limit, low storage, and revoked token scenarios.

Create an API for Blot
- Add webhooks and tell [Aurynn](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1554260da157b405) and [Shawn](https://twitter.com/soypunk)

When the customer's blog does not have a client, client.write and client.remove need to remove the files from the source folder. Create some kind of local client which we fall back and use when none is configured?

Client.write does not propogate sync errors... to demonstrate this, revoke dropbox token then try to enable local editing.
